# ActiniumProxy

Reverse proxy Minecraft with full Forge support and Online mode support. If the backend server is Spigot or Cauldron, you can enable bungeecord mode through spigot.yml to get the correct client IP.

## Differences with BungeeCord

ActiniumProxy is more like NGINX. BungeeCord's goal is to use multiple Minecraft instances like one, ActiniumProxy's goal is to have multiple Minecraft instances share port 25565, like a virtual host for http applications.
